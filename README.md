## Overview

The Catering Project - Frontend is the user interface for our catering web application, where users can explore our menu and request quotes for weddings and events. This README provides essential information about the frontend part of the project.

I have deployed the repo on vercel and it is available to view a live demo. I would really appreciate if you viewed the work I am so proud of and see it in action.
